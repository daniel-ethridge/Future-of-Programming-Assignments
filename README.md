# Future-of-Programming-Assignments
The purpose of this class is to explore the current limits (Spring 2025) of LLMs for programming. Notably the Claude 3.5 Sonnet LLM utilized through github copilot

# Assignment 1: Implementing a Binary Search Tree
- Assignment instructions are [here](https://github.com/johnsogg/bst) 
- By hand, everything up to the remove function was completed with passing tests in 1 hour and 55 minutes.
- Using copilot, the entire assignments was completed from start to finish in 7 minutes and 30 seconds.

# Assignment 2: Bouncing Balls
- The assignment prompt was "create an interactive application with colored balls moving around on the screen, bouncing off walls and each other. Any language/framework is OK." This prompt was given verbatim to Copilot.
- The following 5 prompts followed:
    - Please add more interaction.
    - Make a demo display of the next ball to be created off to the left. This ball should automatically update according to slider parameters and colors.
    - Add a random button off to the right and a number box that will add that number of balls to the screen. The balls should have random color, random speed, and random size.
    - Finally, add sound effects that change based on speed and size of the two balls colliding.
    - Sometimes the balls get stuck together or go off screen. If a ball has a large amount of collisions in a short time, or if it goes off the screen, delete it.
- To run the bouncing balls simulator:
    - Clone the repo:
        - By http: `git clone https://github.com/daniel-ethridge/Future-of-Programming-Assignments.git`
        - By ssh: `git clone git@github.com:daniel-ethridge/Future-of-Programming-Assignments.git`
    - Open the file `Future-of-Programming-Assignments/02-bouncing-balls/index.html` in a web browser.

# Assignment 3: Pacman
In about 30 minutes, I created a pacman clone using javascript.
