# Firebase Server for Website
## Assignment Prompt (Slightly Edited)
Write a server and a client. They should communicate using a shared API. The server and client should be written in different languages. The overall system can be whatever you like: a game, a restaurant inventory system, an e-commerce thing, whatever. Write down what you intend to do before you start. This is so you can determine if you achieved your goal, or if you just floated with the wind and happened to make a cool thing. Also, wrap it up with some level of polish so it is coherently presentable.

# My Intentions
As a PhD student, one of the things that I would love to have is a way to sync my Zotero Library to my personal website so that 1) I can view papers from anywhere and 2) the papers I'm referencing are more easily shareable with those who are interested. 

- I want to get Firebase integrated into my website so that I can have an API for my website. This will be written using Javascript.
- I want to have a local gui application on my computer that I can use to manage the sync from my computer. For this, I want to utilize C++ and the [Dear ImGui C++ library](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)

After this is all said and done, I want to be able to open my new desktop application, view my zotero library, see which papers are syncronized to my website, and choose to sync/unsync any via api calls handled by C++. I want to be able to classify each paper according to topic such that it gets routed to the correct place on my website. Another option for this file organization is for my website to have filters that display various papers depending on what is present.
